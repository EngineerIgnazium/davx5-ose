    <string name="why_badges_body">DAVx5 has really grown over the years! We are still actively developing new features, providing support and we always update the app for upcoming Android versions. These badges are one-time payments where you can simply show your support by buying us a coffee, or two&#8230; or 10 :-) We want to be as open as possible, so there will never-ever be any new stuff locked to in-app payment.</string>
